Hey there, I'm Alina. I like to think of myself as a creative developer, and I am looking forward to become a part of the Nosto team! And yes, you guessed it - I'm also a big fan of Friends and gifs!

### How did I approach this task?

1. Review the task and design specifications

Initially, I reviewed the technical and design specification provided, and did some quick research on slick and jQuery.

2. Set up the project
3. Import styles, jQuery and slick
4. Implement the layout

   This part looked something like that...

5. Clean up and refactor the code

6. Final words

Naturally, the project was crafted with a lot of google search. While I'm quite happy with how it turned out, I know there are plenty of details I could make even better. :)
